Notes:
Read AAAI paper from '06 from Rochester guy?

Argument:
ConceptNet provides triples (R P1 P2) specifying, with high probability, that P1 R P2
  and for a given relation R, we have 100's of triples.
Given a set of sentence contexts (or windows) that contain a P1 and P2 from a known triple,
  we hypothesize that, in general, these provide implicit contexts that express or 
  assume the underlying relation

Goals:
- We want to train a classifier C which, given a window with two new phrases P3 and P4
  is able to provide an assessment of whether the relation R is expressed or not
- We want to train a classifier C which, given a _set_ of windows with two phrases 
  P3 and P4 discriminates whether P3 and P4 are a valid pair under relation R

Complications:
- Multiple valid R's, choosing one
- May need many windows to determine whether R holds in general, rather than in a given
  instance (knowledge acquisition vs. semantic extraction)
- 



Possible goals:
- Test relation validity
- Discover new relations
- <phrase> causes ....

Rerun analysis:
- 

Stages:
1) Retrieve pattern examples
2) Generalize patterns
3) Broad reach for instances
4) Focused mining of instances
5) Filtering, scoring and selection

Improvements:
- Bootstrapping
- Better ranking (recall, etc)


Approach:
- If a pair shows up with negation and conditionality quite
  often, then it is likely commonsense as a common rule doesn't 
  need expression but exceptions will.
- Bias sample by pre-labeling windows using keyword/templates:
  - Count negative patterns
  - Count conditional patterns
  - Count direct expressions
  - Look at governing verb in events
  - Look at noun classes
- Reasoning:
