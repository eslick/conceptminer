This is a rather complex and undocumented system I built for my own use in my MS thesis back in 2005 and 2006.  I'm providing it as a point of interest, but have no interest in supporting it as it is.  It has some interesting ppaarallel processing abstractions, leverages the Elephant PODB, and performs mining of web content to add relational knowledge to semantic resources like ConceptNet.

The system is written in Common Lisp
