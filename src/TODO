WORK:
- Fix id->token persistent map
- Handle person terms and possessives during query gen and matching phrases
- Filter empty concept searches
- Analyze and filter any bad windows that arise

- Develop a theory of info content in windows
  What features are needed, how to classify
- List of pragmatic assumptions from web text

- Write up a chapter on analysis


Extend:
- Analyze capableof, motivationof, desireof, usedfor, effectof
          desirouseffectof, prerequesiteeventof
- Maybe analyze: subeventof, firstsubeventof, lastsubeventof
- Searching for a practical theory of commonsense causality, 
  intentions and desires/goals

Bonus:
- Extract information from educational commonsense website
- Extract and index information from wikipedia

Summer high performance hack:
- Proper transaction support for cminer + ele
- Handle thrown transaction messages
- Debug startup memory issue in elephant
- Flow control & quanta
- Write a parallel dispatch component for searching
- Make sure elephant threading is done right
- Intra-image RPC for multi-CPU collection
- Elephant remote backend
- Elephant query language

MP Hack:
- Searcher/Fetchers/Taggers (G4's?)
- Indexer (G5)
- Query server (G5)

Performance hacks:
- Get rid of memory usage in html-translate-specials
- Reuse a string buffer pool in fetch->tag?

===============
Architectural prototype:

Planning:
- Island planning (Polya:)
  - What is a state?  Some variable; but complex, messy meaning
  - Successive refinement (split plans top down, when can't search)
    - Abstract templates (heirarchy) (find intermediate states to reduce search)
    - Related situations (analogy) + structural correspondence library
  - Search (think of everything you can, follow consequences, see if you
            invoke a template or analogy as above)
  - Simulation (choose next step by simulation, best-first)

================
Big problems:
- Population
- Energy
- Water
- Food
- Transportation
- Global warming 
- Geologic events / catastrophies
- Other resources
- Wellness & Disease
- Political stability
- Poverty
- Education
- Preservation

= Commonsense in the context of World Wide Work (by 13th)
-> Commonsense Compression (minimal BW requirement to
     enable very low latency remote comm)
   - Local computer computes intent of actions
   - Transmits current guess
   - Remote computer takes compact intent, current state
     and drives actions and informs local model of possible
     feedback models
   - Human learns to control a slightly longer delay body
-> Prosthetics + neural control
   - Complex program learns what your brain means; a form of comm
-> Human Robotics
-> Communications & sensing
-> Machine human interface
   -> Multi-lingual speech
   -> Human pilot -> machine
   -> Machine -> human viewer
   -> Virtual reality models / haptic chamber
   -> Step towards the "holodeck"
-> Psychology
   -> Uncanny valley
   -> Personalization
-> Steps towards android

= Universal humanoid work/embodiment
- Un-embodied - servant/companion/teacher
- Human use as training set

= Biz model
- Toyota/Honda

==============

OpenMind Study
= limit miner to short sentences (launch on Deductive!?)
- % of sentences > 10 words
- fetch pages for 100 queries of < 10 words & full-text-index
  Do query to find query phrases in pages
- label queries with info re: size

;;;
;;; Useful Features

- Proper rule-based restarts in pcomp
- Timeouts for stuck stacks in pcomp
- Good query langauge for elephant
- Auto debugging logs in pcomp
